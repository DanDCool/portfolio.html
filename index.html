            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Typing Machine</h3>
                    <p>The typing machine was my first project. It involved a few simple commands and the CLion console as the interface for the user
                    to be able to input strings inside, and then put the commands that they want to use on the said string.
                    This project could and was easily done in one day, and later was fixed and enhanced over the following days.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Mine Sweeper</h3>
                    <p>This project involves creating a console-based version of the classic Minesweeper game. 
                        The game requires the player to uncover all safe cells and flag the mines without triggering any. 
                        The player interacts with a grid where mines are randomly placed, and numbers indicate the number of adjacent mines. 
                        The project includes features like different difficulty levels, a player ranking system, and saving game progress to a file. 
                        It also requires handling game logic for revealing and flagging cells, and managing player scores.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Future projects</h3>
                    <p>I'm hoping to work fast but effectively on my future projects so I'll have more time learning and doing what I love,
                    which includes learning game development... :D</p>
